## About the Project
This is a first project on Hexlet's platform, which contains pack of little games:
- Brain Calc - A game in which a random operation is selected ("+", "-", "*") and two random numbers are generated. A numerical answer is needed;
- Brain Even - A game in which a random number is generated and the user needs to answer whether this number is even or not;
- Brain GCD - A game in which two random numbers are generated for which it is necessary to determine the greatest common divisor;
- Brain Prime - A game in which a random number is generated and the user needs to determine whether this number is simple or not;
- Brain Arithmetic progression - A game in which a random arithmetic progression is generated with one missing number. The user needs to identify this missing number.

Each of the games has an intuitive interface where the user is consistently asked questions that need to be answered. In each game, you need to give three correct answers - if the user answers correctly, then the game ends with congratulations. If the user gives incorrect answer, the game ends and the user is asked to try to complete the game again.

## Getting started
- Clone the repository
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/ultimaredragon/fullstack-javascript-project-44
```
- Install dependencies
```cmd
cd fullstack-javascript-project-44
make install
```
- Install project
```cmd
make link
```

## Usage
### Brain Calc
A game in which a random operation is selected ("+", "-", "*") and two random numbers are generated. A numerical answer is needed.

- Launch Brain Calc
```cmd
brain-calc
```

1. First of all, the program asks for the user name. Enter the user name.

2. In the next step, the user will be shown a mathematical expression to which the user needs to give an answer. If the user answers correctly, the following expression will be displayed on the screen.

### Brain Even
A game in which a random number is generated and the user needs to answer whether this number is even or not.

- Launch Brain Even
```cmd
brain-even
```

1. First of all, the program asks for the user name. Enter the user name.
![Brain-Even username enter](https://i.imgur.com/SkPzpG7.png)
2. At the next stage, the user is shown a random number in the range from 1 to 100 and asked if it is even. The user needs to write "yes" or "no". If the user answers correctly, the following number appears.

### Brain GCD
A game in which two random numbers are generated for which it is necessary to determine the greatest common divisor.

- Launch Brain GCD
```cmd
brain-gcd
```

1. First of all, the program asks for the user name. Enter the user name.
![Brain-GCD username enter](https://i.imgur.com/7G9Zrc6.png)
2. In the next step, the user will be shown two random numbers in the range from 1 to 100. The user needs to determine the largest common divisor and write his answer in the program window. If the user answers correctly, the next pair of numbers will appear.

### Brain Prime 
A game in which a random number is generated and the user needs to determine whether this number is prime or not.

- Launch Brain Prime 
```cmd
brain-prime
```

1. First of all, the program asks for the user name. Enter the user name.
![Brain-Prime username enter](https://i.imgur.com/ypI2GBK.png)
2. In the next step, the user will be shown a random number in the range from 1 to 100 and it is necessary to determine whether this number is prime or not. If the user gives the correct answer, the following number will appear.
![Brain-Prime right answer](https://i.imgur.com/xrqBP1o.png)
3. If the user gives an incorrect answer, a corresponding message will appear on the screen and the game will end with an offer to try next time.

### Brain Arithmetic progression 
A game in which a random arithmetic progression is generated with one missing number. The user needs to identify this missing number.

- Launch Brain Arithmetic progression  
```cmd
brain-progression
```

1. First of all, the program asks for the user name. Enter the user name.
![Brain-Progression username enter](https://i.imgur.com/om58kpM.png)
2. In the next step, the user will be presented with a randomly generated arithmetic series of 5 to 10 numbers in length, in which one number is omitted. The user needs to determine the logic of the missing number and enter the answer. If the user answers correctly, the following arithmetic series will appear on the screen.
